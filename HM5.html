<h2>Research 6_R:</h2>

         <p><b>"Think and explain in your own words what is the role that probability plays in Statistics and the relation between the observed distribution and frequencies their “theoretical” counterparts. Do some practical examples where you explain how the concepts of an abstract probability space relate to more “concrete” and “real-world” objects when doing statistics."</p></b>
         <br>
         <p>In descriptive statistics we don’t have any random event that could occur. We just assume to have a dataset that comes from an observation of a phenomenon and we want to summarize and represent data.</p>
         <p>When probability is considered then we are assuming to have some random events and, for each of it, we want to determine how likely that event will occur.</p>
         <p>So, probability is a branch of mathematics that concers the numerical description of how likely an event is to occur while statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.</p>
         <p>The probability theory becomes a tool used in statistics when doing inferential statistics: we want to gather a distribution of some variables for a sample, when starting from an empirical distribution, obtained by observing a real population that is contained into the sample. So, by observing a real population, we make conclusions on a bigger set of statistical units of which we can’t make real observations. We are deriving conclusions of something we don’t know by processing what we know.</p>
         <p>In inferential statistics the probability theory is used to understand what is the probability distribution that most likely generated an empirical distribution. If we know the probability distribution then we can inference conclusions for bigger populations, that we can’t descriptively describe, with the same characteristics of the one observed. Those conclusions aren’t certainly true since are a result of probability theory results. So I can say that a probability distribution is the one that most likely generated an empirical one but it could have been generated by not the most likely.</p>
         <p>Said this, it’s possible to understand what is the relation between observed and probability distributions. The observed distribution is the one that is generated by a particular probability distribution. A probability distribution can generate many real distributions, since it involves randomness, and, for the same reason, an observed distribution can be generated by many different probability distributions. In inferential statistics we want to understand what is the most likely distribution that generated the one we are observing.</p>
         <p>So, in practice, the relation between the two is that a probability distribution generates an empirical distribution.</p>
         <p>One important example of a measure space is a probability space.</p>
         <p>The probability space is a mathematical construct that provides a formal model of a random process or “experiment”.</p>
         <p>For example, one can define a probability space which models the throwing of a dice.</p>
         <p>A probability space is a triple (Ω, M P) where;</p>
         <p>Ω is the set of all the possible outcomes</p>
         <p>M is the set of all possible subsets of Ω</p>
         <p>P A probability function, which assigns each event in the event space a probability, which is a number between 0 and 1.</p>

<h3>Research 7_R</h3>
         <p><b>"Explain the Bayes Theorem and its key role in statistical induction. Describe the different paradigs that can be found within statistical inference (such as”bayesian”, “frequentist” [Fisher, Neyman])."</p></b>
         <br>
         <p>Inductive statistics is way for scientists to make evidence-based decisions based on empirical/experimental results. It is widely based on the probability theory.</p>
         <p>Inductive thinking, in contrast to deductive thinking, follows the opposite direction. For example, we observe new data for a new drug, and we want to reach to a generalized conclusion. Therefore, inductive thinking enables us to create general conclusions based on observation of individual cases. However, conclusions of inductive thinking procedures are influenced by subjective attitudes (of the observer) and have limited validity.</p>
         <p>Methods of inductive statistics (so called statistical induction) can under given assumptions to make general conclusions and to objectively enumerate their degree of confidence. The main aim of inductive statistics is to elaborate procedures how to create general conclusions from empirical data that can substitute subjective inductive thinking by objective inductive thinking based on concepts of probability theory.</p>
         <p>The inference of data for which we have no evidence is possible thanks a theoretical engine, it can deduce what we cannot test and thus collect the data in a theoretical distribution. In this type of statistics (parametric inference) the goal is to create a family of hypothetical normal distributions and enumerate them (through a θ parameter).</p>
         <p>The normal distribution (or Gauss distribution), in probability theory, is a continuous probability distribution that is often used as a first approximation to describe real-valued random variables that tend to concentrate around a single average value. Each distribution is deductible through two parameters σ and τ (that are in θ). What we want to do is to find which parameter θ is most likely given the evidences. With θ, that represent the states of natures or parameters, and a sample E we can do the Probability of P(θ|E) which mean that we compute the probability of θ over the sample E.</p>
         <p>If we consider the probability above P(θ|E) we can use the bayesian approach to compute this probability. To do that, we need to do this computation:</p>
         <p>P(θ|E)= [P(E|θ) * P(θ)] / P(E) </p>
         <p>Where P(θ|E) it represent the Posterior probability, P(E|θ) the likelihood and P(θ) the Prior.</p>

<h3>Research about application(5_RA):</h3>

            <p><b>"Do a web research about the various methods to generate, from a Uniform([0,1)), all the most important random variables (discrete and continuous). Collect all source code you think might be useful code of such algorithms (keep credits and attributions wherever applicable), as they will be useful for our next simulations."</p></b>
            <br>
            <p>In probability theory and statistics, a probability distribution is the mathematical function that gives the probabilities of occurrence of different possible outcomes for an experiment. It is a mathematical description of a random phenomenon in terms of its sample space and the probabilities of events.
            <p>We could make use of different algorithms to retrieve values out of a distribution.
            <p>The inversion method, involves integrating up to an area greater than or equal to the random number
            <p>(which should be generated between 0 and 1 for proper distributions).
            <p>The method is very simple, so I’ll describe it in simple words. First, take cumulative distribution function 𝐹𝑋 of some distribution that you want to sample from. The function takes as input some value 𝑥 and tells you what is the probability of obtaining 𝑋≤𝑥. So
            <p>𝐹𝑋(𝑥)=Pr(𝑋≤𝑥)=𝑝
            <p>inverse of such function function, 𝐹−1𝑋 would take 𝑝 as input and return 𝑥. Notice that 𝑝’s are uniformly distributed — this could be used for sampling from any 𝐹𝑋 if you know 𝐹−1𝑋. The method is called the inverse transform sampling. The idea is very simple: it is easy to sample values uniformly from 𝑈(0,1), so if you want to sample from some 𝐹𝑋, just take values 𝑢∼𝑈(0,1) and pass 𝑢 through 𝐹−1𝑋 to obtain 𝑥’s
            <p>]𝐹−1𝑋(𝑢)=𝑥
            <p>or in R (for normal distribution)
            <p>Acceptance-rejection method, involves choosing an x and y value and testing whether the function of x
            <p>s greater than the y value. If it is, the x value is accepted. Otherwise, the x value is rejected and the
            <p>algorithm tries again. In other words, it is a way to simulate random samples from an unknown (or difficult to sample) distribution (called the target distribution) using random samples from a similar and more convenient distribution. A random subset of the generated samples is rejected; the rest is accepted. The goal is that accepted samples are distributed as if they came from the target probability distribution.</p>
