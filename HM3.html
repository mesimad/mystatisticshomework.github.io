    <h2>Research 4_R:</h2>
                  <p><b>"Explain what are marginal, joint and conditional distributions and how we can explain the Bayes theorem using relative frequencies. Explain the concept of statistical independence and why, in case of independence, the relative joint frequencies are equal to the products of the corresponding marginal frequencies."</p></b>
           <p>Marginal Distribution:</p>
                  <p>The marginal distribution can be obtained,by summing the values of a row for the marginal distribution of X and the values of columns for the marginal distribution of Y. It’s in called marginal distribution because it is usually represented in the margins of the table.</p>
           <p>-Conditional Probability:</p>
                  <p>Given two jointly distributed random variables X and Y, the conditional probability distribution of Y given X is the probability distribution of Y when X is known to be a particular value;
                  <br>P( X = x | Y = y ) = P( X = x AND Y = y) / P( Y = y)</p>
            <p>Joint probability distribution:</p>
                  <p>Given random variables X, Y, the joint probability distribution for those variables is a probability distribution that gives the probability that the variables fall into a specific range of values specified for each variable.
                  <p> It can be expressed as follows:</p>
                  P( X = x AND Y = y ) = P( X = x | Y = y ) * P( Y = y )
                  <br>Or also inverting X and Y since the joint distribution is symmetric:
                  <br>P( X = x AND Y = y ) = P( Y = y AND X = x )</p>
            <p>Bayes Theorem:</p>
                  <p>Bayes' theorem is a mathematical equation used in probability and statistics to calculate conditional probability. In other words, it is used to calculate the probability of an event based on its association with another event. The theorem is also known as Bayes' law or Bayes' rule.</p>
                  <p>P(A|B) = P(A) P(B|A) /  P(B)</p>
                  <p>Which tells us:	 	how often A happens given that B happens, written P(A|B),<br>
                  When we know:	 	how often B happens given that A happens, written P(B|A)<br>
                  and how likely A is on its own, written P(A) <br>
                  and how likely B is on its own, written P(B)</p>
            <p>Statistical independence:</p>
                  <p>Two events are statistically independent, if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of occurrence of the other.
                    Since the joint frequencies of two events X and Y can be expressed as F( X AND Y) = F( X | Y ) *F(Y) if the events are independent, F( X | Y ) = F( X ) since the fact that Y is given doesn’t affect the value of X for the notion of independence itself.
                   </p> 
                   <p> So the joint frequency can be expressed as the product of the marginal frequencies:</p>
                    F (X AND Y) = F( X ) * F( Y ) </p>
                   <br>

        <h3>Research about Theory 2_RA</h3>

                   <p><b>“Do a review about charts useful for statistics and data presentation. What is the chart type that impressed you most and why ?”</p></b>
                   <p>The importance of charts in statistics is easy to understand, when you have to deal with an amount of data you can’t use for your observations only standard deviation, or frequency distribution because this things doesn’t give you a ‘panoramic’ of this amount of data. They give you a details series that can be studied to understand the nature of dataset, but with charts we can do a comparison between specific details about this dataset and we can achieve more knowledge about an amount of data.</p>

        <h3>Research about Theory 3_RA</h3>

                   <p><b>“Do a comprehensive research about the GRAPHICS object and all its members.”</p></b>
                   <p>The graphics object is part of Windows GDI+ which is a class-based API. It enables applications to use graphics and formatted text on both the video display and the printer.
                    The services of Windows GDI+ fall into the following three broad categories:
                    
                    <br>• 2-D vector graphics
                    <br>• Imaging
                    <br>• Typography
                    
                   <br> We are now interested in 2-D vector graphics since it contains the Graphics class.
                    Vector graphics involves drawing primitives (such as lines, curves, and figures) that are specified by sets of points on a coordinate system. For example, a straight line can be specified by its two endpoints, and a rectangle can be specified by a point giving the location of its upper-left corner and a pair of numbers giving its width and height. A simple path can be specified by an array of points to be connected by straight lines.
                    GDI+ provides classes that store information about the primitives themselves, classes that store information about how the primitives are to be drawn, and classes that actually do the drawing.
                    
                    <p>In this category falls the class Graphics which has methods for drawing lines, rectangles, paths, and other figures. It encapsulates a GDI+ drawing surface, which can be a Bitmap or a Image object, where the figures are drawn. The drawing surface can be then associated to an image container, like a PictureBox, to display the drawing.
                    We can divide Graphics class methods into three categories: draw and fill. Draw methods are used to draw lines, curves, and outer boundaries of closed curves and images. Fill methods fill the interior area of graphics objects.</p>
                    </p>
        <h3>Draw Methods</h3>

                    <p>As the name suggests these methods allow us to draw several kinds of shapes on an image. These methods have all similar names like Draw[object]. Some examples of these methods have already been used in my previous projects:
                    <br> DrawEllipse: draws an ellipse on the related image;
                    <br>DrawRectangle: draws a Rectangle object on the related image.</p>
        <h3>Fill Methods</h3>
        
                    <p>The previously described methods will only draw the outline of a possible object. Therefore, if we want to fill in the drawn figures, we have to ask the correspondent method.</p>
                        <p>For example, if we use the DrawRectangle method, we will only see the outline of the rectangle on the screen. To fill it with some color, we need to use the method FillRectangle of the Graphics class.</p>
                       <p>In general, every Draw method that draws a closed shape has the correspondent Fill method to fill the interior of the shape. This time, instead of using a Pen object, Fill methods require the use of a Brush object that defines the characteristics of the fill.</p>
