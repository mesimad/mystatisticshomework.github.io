    <h2>Research 1_R:</h2>

            <p> <b>"Give your best description of the many reaching out of statistics, in its various form, as a branch of math (Probability theory, etc.), as a set of methodologies used in many other disciplines, as an essential tool to deal with any sort of data, make reports and provide governance tools. Discuss whether it can be considered a "science" and what is the "scientific method" (what is a "theory" and what is a "hypothesis"). What is the role of Statistics in Math and Science?"</p> </b>
            <p>-Statistics: is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model to be studied. Populations can be diverse groups of people or objects such as “all people living in a country” or “every atom composing a crystal”. Statistics deals with every aspect of data, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments.
            The field of statistics is the science of learning from data.Statistical knowledge helps you use the proper methods to collect the data, employ the correct analyses, and effectively present the results. Statistics allows you to understand a subject much more deeply. The purpose of Statistics teaches people to use a limited sample to make intelligent and accurate conclusions about a greater population. Infact doctors, engineers, artists, and practitioners all use statistics to make predictions about future events. For example, doctors use statistics to understand the future of the disease. They can predict the magnitude of the flue in each winter season through the use of data and it is used to monitor and improve the quality of products and processes within a business organization. Statistical analysis is essential for the development of social science theories, being used to test their validity through a robust analysis of real-world data; statistics play an important role in the “scientific method”, it allow us to collect and visualize an amount of data to start an experiment. Infact first step is obseravation and classification of some events that can tell us intrinsic nature. In this way all experiments about a many diffrent branch of study, like Maths or Science in general, put at the ground to build foundations to solve problems or to demonstrate some theories.</p>

            - when a button is pressed some text appears in a richtexbox on the startup form. 
            <br>
            - when another button is pressed animate one or more balls (possibly of different colors and sizes) within a rectangle</p> </b>
